# AWS Resource Isolation Guide for Multiple Teams

## Overview
This document provides a step-by-step guide to isolating AWS resources and users for different teams. It includes setting up AWS Organizations, Service Control Policies (SCPs), IAM policies, and resource tagging strategies.

## Step 1: Create Organizational Units (OUs)

1. **Log in to AWS Management Console**.
2. **Navigate to AWS Organizations**.
3. **Create OUs** for each team (e.g., `DevTeam`, `OpsTeam`, `AdminTeam`).
4. **Create Separate AWS Accounts** within each OU as needed for resource isolation.

## Step 2: Implement Service Control Policies (SCPs)

1. **Create SCPs** for each OU to restrict services and actions.
   - Example SCP for `DevTeam` allows only EC2, S3, and DynamoDB services.

## Step 3: Create IAM Policies for Team-Specific Access

1. **Create Custom IAM Policies** for each team.
   - Example IAM Policy for `DevTeam` grants access to EC2 and S3, but denies termination of instances.

## Step 4: Enforce Resource Tagging

1. **Define and Enforce Tagging Policies** for all resources.
2. **Create IAM Policies** that require tags on resource creation.

## Step 5: Set Up Cross-Account Access and Billing Management

1. **Create IAM Roles** for cross-account access.
   - Example role grants read-only access to S3.
2. **Use Consolidated Billing** to manage costs across all accounts.

## Step 6: Monitor and Audit Resource Usage

1. **Enable CloudTrail** in all accounts for logging.
2. **Enable AWS Config** for compliance tracking.
3. **Set Up AWS Budgets** and alerts to monitor spending.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will ensure that AWS resources are properly isolated for different teams and users, with strict control over access and resource management.
