# AWS Resource Isolation Guide for Multiple Teams within a Single Account

## Overview
This document provides a guide to isolating AWS resources and users for different teams within a single AWS account. It covers setting up IAM groups, enforcing resource tagging, network isolation using VPCs, and fine-grained access control.

## Step 1: Create IAM Groups

1. **Create IAM Groups** for each team (`DevTeam`, `OpsTeam`, `AdminTeam`).
2. **Attach IAM Policies** that define access to specific services (e.g., EC2, S3 for `DevTeam`).

## Step 2: Enforce Resource Tagging

1. **Define and Enforce Tagging Strategy**:
   - Ensure all resources are tagged with `Team=DevTeam`, etc.
2. **Attach IAM Policies** that require tags during resource creation.

## Step 3: Isolate Network Resources

1. **Create Separate VPCs** for each team.
2. **Restrict Access** between VPCs and ensure each team only manages their VPC.

## Step 4: Implement Fine-Grained Access Control

1. **Create IAM Roles** for resource-specific tasks.
2. **Implement Resource-Based Policies** (e.g., S3 bucket policies) for additional control.

## Step 5: Set Up Billing and Cost Management

1. **Tag Resources** for cost tracking.
2. **Set Up Budgets** and alerts for each team.
3. **Monitor Costs** using AWS Cost Explorer.

## Step 6: Monitor and Audit Activity

1. **Enable AWS CloudTrail** for logging and monitoring.
2. **Use AWS Config** for resource compliance and configuration monitoring.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will ensure that resources and access are properly isolated for different teams within a single AWS account, with effective control and monitoring mechanisms in place.
